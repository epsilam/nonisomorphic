# nonisomorphic
Small library of graph theory related functions that finds all the different undirected graphs (including multigraphs) up to isomorphism, for an arbitrary number of vertices and edges.

This is an improved version of a small script used for a school project, originally inspired by a textbook exercise: 
>How many non-isomorphic graphs are there with 4 vertices and 3 edges?

Usage: call `nonIsomorphicGraphs(v, e)` for `v` vertices and `e` edges in `noniso.py`. The file `srclib.py` contains some useful functions that don't necessarily have anything to do with graph theory but are necessary nonetheless.
